# Raising a new issue & requesting Features

Thanks for being an A* tester and helping to make WMail better by either reporting a bug or raising an issue! Before you create a new issue here are a few things that might be worth checking first...

1. Make sure you're using the [latest version and also check the latest pre-releases](https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/releases). You may find that your bug has been fixed or feature added in a pre-release. You can find the full list of all releases available to download along with the changelog for each release on the [releases page](https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/releases)

2. Take a quick look to see if somebody else has already raised an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/issues). It makes it much easier for me to track discussion around a single issue rather than dealing with duplicates

3. Check the [closed issues with the "waiting release" tag](https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AWaiting-release+is%3Aclosed). These are bugs that have been fixed or features that have been added that haven't quite made it into a release just yet. Once an issue is given the waiting release tag it will make it out into a release shortly

4. Some commonly raised issues have their own section in the [FAQs](https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/wiki/FAQs). The answer to your question may be there already!

Once you're happy that your issue / feature hasn't already been raised or fixed feel free to raise it!
