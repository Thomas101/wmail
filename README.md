Feeling brave and want to build from source? Here's what you need to do

Firstly you need to get an OAuth client ID and secret from Google.
Visit https://console.developers.google.com to get started.
You'll need to [setup your OAuth Client ID](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and enable the [Gmail](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail/overview), [Google+](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/plus/overview) and [Identity Toolkit](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/identitytoolkit/overview) APIs.

To create OAuth client ID & secret, under "API Manager", choose "Create Credentials", then "OAuth client ID".
For "Application type", select "Other", and choose some name for the application, as described in these screenshots:

![Create OAuth client ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thomas101/wmail/master/github_images/gdc-oauth-client-id-creation.png "Create OAuth Client ID")

Next create `src/shared/credentials.js` with your Google client ID and secret like so...

```js
module.exports = Object.freeze({
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID : '<Your google client id>',
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: '<Your google client secret>'
})
```

Then run the following...

```
npm install webpack -g
npm run-script install-all
npm start
```

### Packaging Builds

To package builds. (Note packaging osx builds can only be done from osx)
```
brew install msitools
npm install
npm rebuild
npm run-script package
```
