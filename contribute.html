          WMail wasn't created by a company, nor does it have a team that works
          on it 24/7, it was created by a passionate individual helped by the
          open source community. You can help make WMail even better by
          contributing, even just once!

            <h3>Test a Pre-Release</h3>
            <p>
              Pre-Releases make it out into the wild much more regularly than
              normal Releases. These include new features but do sometimes introduce
              new bugs. With an increasing amount of supported platforms you can
              help squash these sooner by using a Pre-Release on a day-to-day
              basis. (P.S. Don't forget to report the bugs)

              open an issue on the Projects GitHub page or add more information

              If you have a spare few minutes why not take a look at the open
              isues on GitHub? Maybe you can help another user, confirm that a
              bug exists or test that a bug works in different environments.
              (e.g. on a different Operating System). Helping to provide more
              information about bugs makes them easier to resolve
